# About

A little about me

---

- creator - supporter - consumer (in that order)
- Things I think / write / work on
  - Systems thinking and abstractions
  - Knowledge systems and process of learning
  - Emotional systems and their role in various other systems
  - Role of knowledge systems, emotional systems and culture in Organizational design
  - Engineering ( this includes software, hardware, and mechanical )
  - Role of knowledge in progress [[philosophy]]
- Get in touch
  - I can be reached at ping @ domain ( where these notes are hosted )
  - I'm not very active on various forms of social media
- Disclaimer
  - All thoughts here are mine ( not of any entity I may be associated with ).
  - All are working notes, they are by definition incomplete and therefore only represent my knowledge system in a given space-time-social context, they are likely to change.
  - Most of these notes flow in the way I think which is often as conversations with myself, therefore both first and second person pronouns represent "me", in case of third person I usually make it explicit what/who that entity is.
